# HnR'26 hardware badge: hardware source files

This directory contains the [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) 9 hardware source
files for the Hack&Roll 2026 hardware badge.

## Manufacturing

We used [JLCPCB manufacturing services](https://jlcpcb.com/) for the hardware
badges. To help with component parts assignment and generating JLCPCB-compatible
files, we used the open source
[KiCAD JLCPCB tools](https://github.com/bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools) plugin.

## License

The hardware source files in this directory are open-sourced, licensed under
CERN-OHL-P-2.0. See [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for the full license text.
